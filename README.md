# ðŸ¥‹ dotnet-dojo

Welcome to the **dotnet-dojo** â€” a personal coding dojo for sharpening my C# and .NET skills.

This is where I train through hands-on practice, building mini-projects, exploring core concepts, and experimenting with powerful .NET features.
This repo is just that â€” a space to experiment, make mistakes, and level up one commit at a time.

## ðŸ§  Topics I'm Exploring
- C# fundamentals & object-oriented programming
-


### ðŸš§ Always Under Construction
Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or just say hi!
