# 🥋 dotnet-dojo

Welcome to the **dotnet-dojo** — a personal coding dojo for sharpening my C# and .NET skills.

This is where I train through hands-on practice, building mini-projects, exploring core concepts, and experimenting with powerful .NET features.

## 🧠 Topics I'm Exploring
- C# fundamentals & object-oriented programming
- ASP.NET Core (Web APIs, MVC)
- Entity Framework Core
- LINQ, async/await, and generics
- Unit testing with xUnit & MSTest
- .NET CLI & project structure

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- .NET SDK 8+
- Visual Studio Code / Rider
- Postman / Swagger
- Git & GitHub

## 🥷 Why “Dojo”?
In martial arts, a **dojo** is a place of focused training. This repo is just that — a space to experiment, make mistakes, and level up one commit at a time.
